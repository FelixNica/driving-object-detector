# driving-object-detector
DOD is a deep object detection algorithm implemented using Keras/Tensorflow, developed based on Joseph Redmon's 
Darknet-"You only look once V2" and optimized to perform detections specific to vehicle self driving applications.

#### Credit where due:

[Joseph Redmon](https://pjreddie.com/): approach to training a neural network for object detection and publishing the 
weights files - this project uses the feature extraction section of his model converted to Keras.
- [Original YOLO publication](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.02640.pdf) - main inspiration for this project
- [YOLO V3 - Latest publication in object detection](https://pjreddie.com/media/files/papers/YOLOv3.pdf) - not used here
but very cool

[Guillaume Ram√©](https://github.com/guigzzz): developing the loss calculation approach compatible with Keras models. 
How list predictions are converted to y_train vectors for training is largely a product of his work.
